## 2021-08-19 How to go forward?

The project shows for some time for various private reasons no progress. Coming back to the source code shows me that I have to be careful not to over-engineer resutling in a too complex approach.
My target is short term:

- simple target labelling
- set up machine learning on the basis of artificial data (e.g. sine data) to check the base mechanism
- establish a visualization - probably one of: Plots, Dash, VegaLite, Makie
