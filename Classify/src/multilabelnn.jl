You’re describing a multi-label classification scenario, where each input sample can be associated with multiple class labels simultaneously. In such cases, the traditional approach of selecting a single class label (as done with onecold) doesn’t apply.

Here’s how you can adapt your classifier for multi-label classification:

Data Preparation:
Ensure your dataset is annotated with multiple labels for each sample.
For instance, if you have images, each image may belong to several categories (e.g., “cat,” “dog,” “outdoor,” “sunset,” etc.).
Model Architecture:
Use a neural network architecture that supports multi-label classification.
Common choices include:
Binary Relevance: Train a separate binary classifier for each label. Each classifier predicts whether the sample belongs to that specific label or not.
Multi-Label Neural Networks: Modify the output layer to have multiple units (one for each class). Use sigmoid activation instead of softmax.
Label Powerset: Treat each combination of labels as a separate class.
Loss Function:
For multi-label classification, use a suitable loss function.
Binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss is commonly used. It computes the loss for each label independently and then averages them.
BCE loss accounts for the fact that multiple labels can be correct simultaneously.
Output Layer Activation:
In multi-label scenarios, use sigmoid activation for the output layer.
Sigmoid ensures that each class probability lies between 0 and 1 independently.
Thresholding:
After obtaining probabilities for each label, you need to decide which labels to assign.
Set a threshold (e.g., 0.5) for each class. If the predicted probability exceeds the threshold, consider it as a positive label.
Adjust the threshold based on your desired trade-off between precision and recall.
Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy alone is insufficient for multi-label classification.
Consider using metrics like:
Precision: Proportion of correctly predicted positive instances among all predicted positive instances.
Recall: Proportion of correctly predicted positive instances among all actual positive instances.
F1-score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
